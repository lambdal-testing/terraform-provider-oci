data "oci_metering_computation_schedule" "test_schedule" {
	#Required
	schedule_id = oci_metering_computation_schedule.test_schedule.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `schedule_id` - (Required) The schedule unique OCID.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The customer tenancy.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. See [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `description` - The description of the schedule.
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. See [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `id` - The OCID representing a unique shedule.
* `name` - The unique name of the schedule created by the user.
* `output_file_format` - Specifies the supported output file format.
* `query_properties` - The query properties.
	* `compartment_depth` - The depth level of the compartment.

		* `time_usage_ended` - The usage end time.
		* `time_usage_started` - The usage start time.
	* `filter` - The filter object for query usage.
	* `granularity` - The usage granularity. DAILY - Daily data aggregation. MONTHLY - Monthly data aggregation. Allowed values are: DAILY MONTHLY 
	* `group_by` - Aggregate the result by. For example: [ "tagNamespace", "tagKey", "tagValue", "service", "skuName", "skuPartNumber", "unit", "compartmentName", "compartmentPath", "compartmentId", "platform", "region", "logicalAd", "resourceId", "tenantId", "tenantName" ] 
	* `group_by_tag` - GroupBy a specific tagKey. Provide the tagNamespace and tagKey in the tag object. Only supports one tag in the list. For example: [ { "namespace": "oracle", "key": "createdBy" ] 
		* `key` - The tag key.
		* `namespace` - The tag namespace.
