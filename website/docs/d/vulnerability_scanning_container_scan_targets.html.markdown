# Data Source: oci_vulnerability_scanning_container_scan_targets
This data source provides the list of Container Scan Targets in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vulnerability Scanning service.

Retrieves a list of ContainerScanTargetSummary objects in a compartment. A container scan target specifies a group of one or more Docker image repositories in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry (OCIR) that you want routinely scanned for security vulnerabilities.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_vulnerability_scanning_container_scan_targets" "test_container_scan_targets" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	display_name = var.container_scan_target_display_name
	state = var.container_scan_target_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The ID of the compartment in which to list resources.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire display name given.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources whose lifecycleState matches the given lifecycleState.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `container_scan_target_summary_collection` - The list of container_scan_target_summary_collection.

### ContainerScanTarget Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the container scan target's compartment
* `container_scan_recipe_id` - ID of the container scan recipe this target applies.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `description` - Target description.
* `display_name` - User friendly name of container scan target
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of container scan target. Immutable and generated on creation.
* `state` - The current state of the config.
* `system_tags` - Usage of system tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}` 
* `target_registry` - Registry information for a container scan target
	* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment to perform the scans in. All listed repositories must be in the compartment.
	* `repositories` - List of repositories to scan images in. If left empty, the target defaults to scanning all repos in the compartmentId
	* `type` - The scan level
	* `url` - URL of the registry.
* `time_created` - Date and time the target was created, format as described in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339)
* `time_updated` - Date and time the target was last updated, format as described in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339)
