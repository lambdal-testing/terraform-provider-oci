# Data Source: oci_vulnerability_scanning_container_scan_recipes
This data source provides the list of Container Scan Recipes in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vulnerability Scanning service.

Retrieves a list of ContainerScanRecipeSummary objects in a compartment. A recipe determines the types of security issues that you want scanned.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_vulnerability_scanning_container_scan_recipes" "test_container_scan_recipes" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	display_name = var.container_scan_recipe_display_name
	state = var.container_scan_recipe_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The ID of the compartment in which to list resources.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire display name given.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources whose lifecycleState matches the given lifecycleState.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `container_scan_recipe_summary_collection` - The list of container_scan_recipe_summary_collection.

### ContainerScanRecipe Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the container scan recipe's compartment
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}`

* `image_count` - This field is set equal to the number of images we want to scan in the first go when the recipe is created
* `scan_settings` - A collection of container scan settings
	* `scan_level` - The scan level
