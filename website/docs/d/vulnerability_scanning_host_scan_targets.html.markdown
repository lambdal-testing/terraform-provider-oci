# Data Source: oci_vulnerability_scanning_host_scan_targets
This data source provides the list of Host Scan Targets in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vulnerability Scanning service.

Retrieves a list of HostScanTargetSummary objects in a compartment. A host scan target is a collection of compute instances that you want routinely scanned for security vulnerabilities.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_vulnerability_scanning_host_scan_targets" "test_host_scan_targets" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	display_name = var.host_scan_target_display_name
	state = var.host_scan_target_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The ID of the compartment in which to list resources.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire display name given.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources whose lifecycleState matches the given lifecycleState.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `host_scan_target_summary_collection` - The list of host_scan_target_summary_collection.

### HostScanTarget Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - Compartment ID of the object (this).
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `description` - Target description.
* `display_name` - Target identifier, which can be renamed.
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `host_scan_recipe_id` - ID of the host scan recipe this target applies.
* `id` - Unique identifier of the config that is immutable on creation
* `instance_ids` - List of compute instance IDs to target (optional). If empty, targets the entire targetCompartmentId.
* `state` - The current state of the config.
* `system_tags` - Usage of system tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}` 
* `target_compartment_id` - Compartment ID to target. If a list of hosts is provided, all hosts must be in this compartment.
* `time_created` - Date and time the target was created, format as described in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339)
* `time_updated` - Date and time the target was last updated, format as described in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339)
