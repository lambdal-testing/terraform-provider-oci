# Data Source: oci_vulnerability_scanning_host_scan_target_error
This data source provides details about a specific Host Scan Target Error resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vulnerability Scanning service.

Retrieves list of errors during scanning on instances associated with HostScanTarget identified by the target ID. A host scan target is a collection of compute instances that you want routinely scanned for security vulnerabilities.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_vulnerability_scanning_host_scan_target_error" "test_host_scan_target_error" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	host_scan_target_id = oci_vulnerability_scanning_host_scan_target.test_host_scan_target.id

	#Optional
	state = var.host_scan_target_error_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The ID of the compartment in which to list resources.
* `host_scan_target_id` - (Required) unique HostScanTarget identifier
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources whose lifecycleState matches the given lifecycleState.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `items` - The HostScanTargetError objects in the collection.
	* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
	* `error_code` - Error code of task failure.
	* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
	* `instance_id` - OCID of the host instance where scan was done.
	* `message` - Error message detailing task failure.
	* `state` - The current state of the config.
	* `system_tags` - Usage of system tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}` 
	* `task` - Task during scan which failed.
	* `time_updated` - Date and time the error was updated, format as described in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339).
	* `vendor` - Vendor which was used for the host scan agent.
