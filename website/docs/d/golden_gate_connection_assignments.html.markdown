# Data Source: oci_golden_gate_connection_assignments
This data source provides the list of Connection Assignments in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Golden Gate service.

Lists the Connection Assignments in the compartment.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_golden_gate_connection_assignments" "test_connection_assignments" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	connection_id = oci_golden_gate_connection.test_connection.id
	deployment_id = oci_golden_gate_deployment.test_deployment.id
	name = var.connection_assignment_name
	state = var.connection_assignment_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The OCID of the compartment that contains the work request. Work requests should be scoped  to the same compartment as the resource the work request affects. If the work request concerns  multiple resources, and those resources are not in the same compartment, it is up to the service team  to pick the primary resource whose compartment should be used. 
* `connection_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the connection. 
* `deployment_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the deployment in which to list resources. 
* `name` - (Optional) The name of the connection in the assignment (aliasName).
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only connection assignments having the 'lifecycleState' given.
