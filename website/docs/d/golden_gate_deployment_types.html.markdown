# Data Source: oci_golden_gate_deployment_types
This data source provides the list of Deployment Types in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Golden Gate service.

Returns an array of DeploymentTypeDescriptor


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_golden_gate_deployment_types" "test_deployment_types" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	deployment_type = var.deployment_type_deployment_type
	display_name = var.deployment_type_display_name
	ogg_version = var.deployment_type_ogg_version
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The OCID of the compartment that contains the work request. Work requests should be scoped  to the same compartment as the resource the work request affects. If the work request concerns  multiple resources, and those resources are not in the same compartment, it is up to the service team  to pick the primary resource whose compartment should be used.  
* `deployment_type` - (Optional) The type of deployment, the value determines the exact 'type' of the service executed in the deployment. Default value is DATABASE_ORACLE. 
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only the resources that match the entire 'displayName' given. 
* `ogg_version` - (Optional) Allows to query by a specific GoldenGate version.
