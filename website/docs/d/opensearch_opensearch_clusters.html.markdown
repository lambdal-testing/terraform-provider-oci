# Data Source: oci_opensearch_opensearch_clusters
This data source provides the list of Opensearch Clusters in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Opensearch service.

Returns a list of OpensearchClusters.

## Prerequisites
The below policies must be created in compartment before creating OpensearchCluster

##### {Compartment-Name} - Name of  your compartment
```
Allow service opensearch to manage vnics in compartment {Compartment-Name}
Allow service opensearch to use subnets in compartment {Compartment-Name}
Allow service opensearch to use network-security-groups in compartment {Compartment-Name}
Allow service opensearch to manage vcns in compartment {Compartment-Name}
```

For latest documentation on OpenSearch use please refer to https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/search-opensearch/home.htm  
Required permissions: https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/search-opensearch/Concepts/ocisearchpermissions.htm

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_opensearch_opensearch_clusters" "test_opensearch_clusters" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	display_name = var.opensearch_cluster_display_name
	id = var.opensearch_cluster_id
	state = var.opensearch_cluster_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The ID of the compartment in which to list resources.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire display name given.
* `id` - (Optional) unique OpensearchCluster identifier
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only OpensearchClusters their lifecycleState matches the given lifecycleState.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:
