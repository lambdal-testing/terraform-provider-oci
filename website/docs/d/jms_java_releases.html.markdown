### JavaRelease Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `artifact_content_types` - Artifact content types for the Java version.
* `artifacts` - List of Java artifacts.
	* `approximate_file_size_in_bytes` - Approximate compressed file size in bytes.
	* `architecture` - The target Operating System architecture for the artifact.
	* `artifact_content_type` - Product content type of this artifact.
	* `artifact_description` - Description of the binary artifact. Typically includes the OS, architecture, and installer type.
	* `artifact_file_name` - The file name of the artifact.
	* `artifact_id` - Unique identifier for the artifact.
	* `download_url` - The endpoint that returns a short-lived artifact download URL in the response payload. This download url can then be used for downloading the artifact. See this [API](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/jms/20230601/JavaArtifact/GenerateArtifactDownloadUrl) for more details. 
	* `os_family` - The target Operating System family for the artifact.
