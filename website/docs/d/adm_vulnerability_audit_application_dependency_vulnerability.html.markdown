# Data Source: oci_adm_vulnerability_audit_application_dependency_vulnerability
This data source provides details about a specific Vulnerability Audit Application Dependency Vulnerability resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure ADM service.

Returns a list of Application Dependencies with their associated vulnerabilities.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_adm_vulnerability_audit_application_dependency_vulnerability" "test_vulnerability_audit_application_dependency_vulnerability" {
	#Required
	vulnerability_audit_id = oci_adm_vulnerability_audit.test_vulnerability_audit.id

	#Optional
	cvss_v2greater_than_or_equal = var.vulnerability_audit_application_dependency_vulnerability_cvss_v2greater_than_or_equal
	cvss_v3greater_than_or_equal = var.vulnerability_audit_application_dependency_vulnerability_cvss_v3greater_than_or_equal
	depth = var.vulnerability_audit_application_dependency_vulnerability_depth
	gav = var.vulnerability_audit_application_dependency_vulnerability_gav
	root_node_id = oci_adm_root_node.test_root_node.id
	vulnerability_id = oci_adm_vulnerability.test_vulnerability.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `cvss_v2greater_than_or_equal` - (Optional) A filter that returns only Vulnerability Audits that have a Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 2 (CVSS V2) greater or equal than the specified value. 
* `cvss_v3greater_than_or_equal` - (Optional) A filter that returns only Vulnerability Audits that have a Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 3 (CVSS V3) greater or equal than the specified value. 
* `depth` - (Optional) A filter to limit depth of the application dependencies tree traversal. Additionally query parameters such as "cvssV2GreaterThanOrEqual", "cvssV3GreaterThanOrEqual", "gav" and "vulnerabilityId" can't be used in conjunction with this latter. 
* `gav` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire GAV (Group Artifact Version) identifier given.
* `root_node_id` - (Optional) A filter to override the top level root identifier with the new given value. The application dependency tree will only be traversed from the given node. Query parameters "cvssV2GreaterThanOrEqual", "cvssV3GreaterThanOrEqual", "gav" and "vulnerabilityId" cannot be used in conjunction with this parameter. 
* `vulnerability_audit_id` - (Required) Unique Vulnerability Audit identifier path parameter.
* `vulnerability_id` - (Optional) A filter to return only Vulnerability Audits that match the specified id.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `items` - List of Vulnerability Audit summaries.
	* `application_dependency_node_ids` - List of Application Dependencies on which this Application Dependency depends, each identified by its nodeId.
	* `gav` - Group Artifact Version (GAV) identifier (Group:Artifact:Version), for example org.graalvm.nativeimage:svm:21.1.0.
	* `is_found_in_knowledge_base` - Indicates if the artifact is found in the knowledge base.
	* `node_id` - Unique identifier of an Application Dependency, for example nodeId1.
	* `vulnerabilities` - List of vulnerabilities for the Application Dependency.
		* `cvss_v2score` - Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 2.
		* `cvss_v3score` - Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 3.
		* `id` - Unique vulnerability identifier, e.g. CVE-1999-0067.
		* `is_ignored` - Indicates if the vulnerability was ignored according to the audit configuration.
