# Data Source: oci_opensearch_opensearch_cluster
This data source provides details about a specific Opensearch Cluster resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Opensearch service.

Gets a OpensearchCluster by identifier

## Prerequisites
The below policies must be created in compartment before creating OpensearchCluster

##### {Compartment-Name} - Name of  your compartment
```
Allow service opensearch to manage vnics in compartment {Compartment-Name}
Allow service opensearch to use subnets in compartment {Compartment-Name}
Allow service opensearch to use network-security-groups in compartment {Compartment-Name}
Allow service opensearch to manage vcns in compartment {Compartment-Name}
```

For latest documentation on OpenSearch use please refer to https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/search-opensearch/home.htm  
Required permissions: https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/search-opensearch/Concepts/ocisearchpermissions.htm

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_opensearch_opensearch_cluster" "test_opensearch_cluster" {
	#Required
	opensearch_cluster_id = oci_opensearch_opensearch_cluster.test_opensearch_cluster.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `opensearch_cluster_id` - (Required) unique OpensearchCluster identifier


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:
