Retrieve the log analytics entity with the given id.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_log_analytics_log_analytics_entity" "test_log_analytics_entity" {
	#Required
	log_analytics_entity_id = oci_log_analytics_log_analytics_entity.test_log_analytics_entity.id
	namespace = var.log_analytics_entity_namespace
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `log_analytics_entity_id` - (Required) The log analytics entity OCID. 
* `namespace` - (Required) The Logging Analytics namespace used for the request.

The following attributes are exported:

* `are_logs_collected` - The Boolean flag to indicate if logs are collected for an entity for log analytics usage. 
* `cloud_resource_id` - The OCID of the Cloud resource which this entity is a representation of. This may be blank when the entity represents a non-cloud resource that the customer may have on their premises. 
* `compartment_id` - Compartment Identifier [OCID] (https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}`

* `id` - The log analytics entity OCID. This ID is a reference used by log analytics features and it represents a resource that is provisioned and managed by the customer on their premises or on the cloud. 
* `lifecycle_details` - lifecycleDetails has additional information regarding substeps such as management agent plugin deployment.
