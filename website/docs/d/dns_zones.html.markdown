# Data Source: oci_dns_zones
This data source provides the list of Zones in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure DNS service.

Gets a list of all zones in the specified compartment. The collection
can be filtered by name, time created, scope, associated view, and zone type.
Additionally, for Private DNS, the `scope` query parameter is required when 
listing private zones.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_dns_zones" "test_zones" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	name = var.zone_name
	name_contains = var.zone_name_contains
	scope = var.zone_scope
	state = var.zone_state
	time_created_greater_than_or_equal_to = var.zone_time_created_greater_than_or_equal_to
	time_created_less_than = var.zone_time_created_less_than
	tsig_key_id = oci_dns_tsig_key.test_tsig_key.id
	view_id = oci_dns_view.test_view.id
	zone_type = var.zone_zone_type
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The OCID of the compartment the resource belongs to.
* `name` - (Optional) A case-sensitive filter for zone names. Will match any zone with a name that equals the provided value. 
* `name_contains` - (Optional) Search by zone name. Will match any zone whose name (case-insensitive) contains the provided value. 
* `scope` - (Optional) Specifies to operate only on resources that have a matching DNS scope. This value will be null 
for zones in the global DNS and `PRIVATE` when listing private zones.
* `sort_by` - (Optional) The field by which to sort zones. Allowed values are: name|zoneType|timeCreated
* `sort_order` - The order to sort the resources. Allowed values are: ASC|DESC  
* `state` - (Optional) The state of a resource.
* `time_created_greater_than_or_equal_to` - (Optional) An [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) timestamp that states all returned resources were created on or after the indicated time. 
* `time_created_less_than` - (Optional) An [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) timestamp that states all returned resources were created before the indicated time. 
* `tsig_key_id` - (Optional) Search for zones that are associated with a TSIG key. 
* `view_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the view the resource is associated with.
* `zone_type` - (Optional) Search by zone type, `PRIMARY` or `SECONDARY`. Will match any zone whose type equals the provided value. 


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `zones` - The list of zones.

### Zone Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment containing the zone.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).

	 **Example:** `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `external_downstreams` - External secondary servers for the zone. This field is currently not supported when `zoneType` is `SECONDARY` or `scope` is `PRIVATE`. 
	* `address` - The server's IP address (IPv4 or IPv6).
	* `port` - The server's port. Port value must be a value of 53, otherwise omit the port value. 
	* `tsig_key_id` - The OCID of the TSIG key. A TSIG key is used to secure DNS messages (in this case, zone transfers) between two systems that both have the (shared) secret. 
* `external_masters` - External master servers for the zone. `externalMasters` becomes a required parameter when the `zoneType` value is `SECONDARY`. 
	* `address` - The server's IP address (IPv4 or IPv6).
	* `port` - The server's port. Port value must be a value of 53, otherwise omit the port value. 
	* `tsig_key_id` - The OCID of the TSIG key.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).

	 **Example:** `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The OCID of the zone.
* `is_protected` - A Boolean flag indicating whether or not parts of the resource are unable to be explicitly managed. 
* `name` - The name of the zone.
* `nameservers` - The authoritative nameservers for the zone.
	* `hostname` - The hostname of the nameserver.
* `scope` - The scope of the zone.
* `self` - The canonical absolute URL of the resource.
* `serial` - The current serial of the zone. As seen in the zone's SOA record. 
* `state` - The current state of the zone resource.
* `time_created` - The date and time the resource was created in "YYYY-MM-ddThh:mm:ssZ" format with a Z offset, as defined by RFC 3339.

	**Example:** `2016-07-22T17:23:59:60Z` 
* `version` - Version is the never-repeating, totally-orderable, version of the zone, from which the serial field of the zone's SOA record is derived. 
* `view_id` - The OCID of the private view containing the zone. This value will be null for zones in the global DNS, which are publicly resolvable and not part of a private view. 
* `zone_transfer_servers` - The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure nameservers that transfer the zone data with external nameservers. 
	* `address` - The server's IP address (IPv4 or IPv6).
	* `is_transfer_destination` - A Boolean flag indicating whether or not the server is a zone data transfer destination. 
	* `is_transfer_source` - A Boolean flag indicating whether or not the server is a zone data transfer source. 
* `zone_type` - The type of the zone. Must be either `PRIMARY` or `SECONDARY`. `SECONDARY` is only supported for GLOBAL zones.
