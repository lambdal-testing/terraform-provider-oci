# Data Source: oci_log_analytics_namespace_scheduled_task
This data source provides details about a specific Namespace Scheduled Task resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Log Analytics service.

Get the scheduled task for the specified task identifier.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_log_analytics_namespace_scheduled_task" "test_namespace_scheduled_task" {
	#Required
	namespace = var.namespace_scheduled_task_namespace
	scheduled_task_id = oci_log_analytics_scheduled_task.test_scheduled_task.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `namespace` - (Required) The Logging Analytics namespace used for the request. 
* `scheduled_task_id` - (Required) Unique scheduledTask id returned from task create. If invalid will lead to a 404 not found. 


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `action` - Action for scheduled task.
	* `compartment_id_in_subtree` - if true, purge child compartments data
	* `data_type` - the type of the log data to be purged
	* `metric_extraction` - Specify metric extraction for SAVED_SEARCH scheduled task execution to post to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Monitoring. 
		* `compartment_id` - The compartment OCID (https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the extracted metric. 
		* `metric_name` - The metric name of the extracted metric. A valid value starts with an alphabetical character and includes only alphanumeric characters, periods (.), underscores (_), hyphens (-), and dollar signs ($). 
		* `namespace` - The namespace of the extracted metric. A valid value starts with an alphabetical character and includes only alphanumeric characters and underscores (_). 
		* `resource_group` - The resource group of the extracted metric. A valid value starts with an alphabetical character and includes only alphanumeric characters, periods (.), underscores (_), hyphens (-), and dollar signs ($). 
	* `purge_compartment_id` - the compartment OCID under which the data will be purged
	* `purge_duration` - The duration of data to be retained, which is used to calculate the timeDataEnded when the task fires. The value should be negative. Purge duration in ISO 8601 extended format as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations. The largest supported unit is D, e.g. -P365D (not -P1Y) or -P14D (not -P2W). 
	* `query_string` - Purge query string.
	* `saved_search_id` - The ManagementSavedSearch id [OCID] utilized in the action.
	* `type` - Action type discriminator.
* `compartment_id` - Compartment Identifier [OCID] (https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name that is changeable and that does not have to be unique. Format: a leading alphanumeric, followed by zero or more alphanumerics, underscores, spaces, backslashes, or hyphens in any order). No trailing spaces allowed. 
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the data plane resource. 
* `kind` - Discriminator.
* `num_occurrences` - Number of execution occurrences.
* `schedules` - Schedules.
	* `expression` - Value in cron format.
	* `misfire_policy` - Schedule misfire retry policy.
	* `recurring_interval` - Recurring interval in ISO 8601 extended format as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations. The largest supported unit is D, e.g. P14D (not P2W). The value must be at least 5 minutes (PT5M) and at most 3 weeks (P21D or PT30240M). 
	* `repeat_count` - Number of times (0-based) to execute until auto-stop. Default value -1 will execute indefinitely. Value 0 will execute once. 
	* `time_zone` - Time zone, by default UTC.
	* `type` - Schedule type discriminator.
* `state` - The current state of the scheduled task.
* `task_status` - Status of the scheduled task. - PURGE_RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND
* `task_type` - Task type.
* `time_created` - The date and time the scheduled task was created, in the format defined by RFC3339. 
* `time_updated` - The date and time the scheduled task was last updated, in the format defined by RFC3339. 
* `work_request_id` - most recent Work Request Identifier [OCID] (https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) for the asynchronous request.
