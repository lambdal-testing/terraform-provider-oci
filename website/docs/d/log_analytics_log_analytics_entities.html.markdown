# Data Source: oci_log_analytics_log_analytics_entities
This data source provides the list of Log Analytics Entities in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Log Analytics service.

Return a list of log analytics entities.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_log_analytics_log_analytics_entities" "test_log_analytics_entities" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	namespace = var.log_analytics_entity_namespace

	#Optional
	cloud_resource_id = oci_log_analytics_cloud_resource.test_cloud_resource.id
	entity_type_name = var.log_analytics_entity_entity_type_name
	hostname = var.log_analytics_entity_hostname
	hostname_contains = var.log_analytics_entity_hostname_contains
	is_management_agent_id_null = var.log_analytics_entity_is_management_agent_id_null
	lifecycle_details_contains = var.log_analytics_entity_lifecycle_details_contains
	metadata_equals = var.log_analytics_entity_metadata_equals
	name = var.log_analytics_entity_name
	name_contains = var.log_analytics_entity_name_contains
	source_id = oci_log_analytics_source.test_source.id
	state = var.log_analytics_entity_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `cloud_resource_id` - (Optional) A filter to return only log analytics entities whose cloudResourceId matches the cloudResourceId given. 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) The ID of the compartment in which to list resources.
* `entity_type_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only log analytics entities whose entityTypeName matches the entire log analytics entity type name of one of the entityTypeNames given in the list. The match is case-insensitive. 
* `hostname` - (Optional) A filter to return only log analytics entities whose hostname matches the entire hostname given. 
* `hostname_contains` - (Optional) A filter to return only log analytics entities whose hostname contains the substring given. The match is case-insensitive. 
* `is_management_agent_id_null` - (Optional) A filter to return only those log analytics entities whose managementAgentId is null or is not null. 
* `lifecycle_details_contains` - (Optional) A filter to return only log analytics entities whose lifecycleDetails contains the specified string. 
* `metadata_equals` - (Optional) A filter to return only log analytics entities whose metadata name, value and type matches the specified string. Each item in the array has the format "{name}:{value}:{type}".  All inputs are case-insensitive. 
* `name` - (Optional) A filter to return only log analytics entities whose name matches the entire name given. The match is case-insensitive. 
* `name_contains` - (Optional) A filter to return only log analytics entities whose name contains the name given. The match is case-insensitive. 
* `namespace` - (Required) The Logging Analytics namespace used for the request. 
* `source_id` - (Optional) A filter to return only log analytics entities whose sourceId matches the sourceId given. 
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only those log analytics entities with the specified lifecycle state. The state value is case-insensitive. 


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `log_analytics_entity_collection` - The list of log_analytics_entity_collection.

### LogAnalyticsEntity Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `are_logs_collected` - The Boolean flag to indicate if logs are collected for an entity for log analytics usage. 
* `cloud_resource_id` - The OCID of the Cloud resource which this entity is a representation of. This may be blank when the entity represents a non-cloud resource that the customer may have on their premises. 
* `compartment_id` - Compartment Identifier [OCID] (https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `entity_type_internal_name` - Internal name for the log analytics entity type. 
* `entity_type_name` - Log analytics entity type name. 
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `hostname` - The hostname where the entity represented here is actually present. This would be the output one would get if they run `echo $HOSTNAME` on Linux or an equivalent OS command. This may be different from management agents host since logs may be collected remotely. 
* `id` - The log analytics entity OCID. This ID is a reference used by log analytics features and it represents a resource that is provisioned and managed by the customer on their premises or on the cloud. 
* `lifecycle_details` - lifecycleDetails has additional information regarding substeps such as management agent plugin deployment. 
* `management_agent_compartment_id` - Management agent (management-agents resource kind) compartment OCID 
* `management_agent_display_name` - Management agent (management-agents resource kind) display name 
* `management_agent_id` - The OCID of the Management Agent. 
* `metadata` - Details of entity metadata information.
	* `items` - An array of entity metadata.
		* `name` - The metadata name.
		* `type` - The metadata type.
		* `value` - The metadata value.
* `name` - Log analytics entity name. 
* `properties` - The name/value pairs for parameter values to be used in file patterns specified in log sources. 
* `source_id` - This indicates the type of source. It is primarily for Enterprise Manager Repository ID. 
* `state` - The current state of the log analytics entity. 
* `time_created` - The date and time the resource was created, in the format defined by RFC3339. 
* `time_last_discovered` - The date and time the resource was last discovered, in the format defined by RFC3339. 
* `time_updated` - The date and time the resource was last updated, in the format defined by RFC3339. 
* `timezone_region` - The timezone region of the log analytics entity.
