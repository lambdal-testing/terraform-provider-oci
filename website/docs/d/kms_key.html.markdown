# Data Source: oci_kms_key
This data source provides details about a specific Key resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Kms service.

Gets information about the specified master encryption key.

As a management operation, this call is subject to a Key Management limit that applies to the total number
of requests across all management read operations. Key Management might throttle this call to reject an
otherwise valid request when the total rate of management read operations exceeds 10 requests per second for
a given tenancy.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_kms_key" "test_key" {
	#Required
	key_id = oci_kms_key.test_key.id
	management_endpoint = var.key_management_endpoint
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `key_id` - (Required) The OCID of the key.
* `management_endpoint` - (Required) The service endpoint to perform management operations against. Management operations include 'Create,' 'Update,' 'List,' 'Get,' and 'Delete' operations. See Vault Management endpoint.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `auto_key_rotation_details` - The details of auto rotation schedule for the Key being create updated or imported.
	* `last_rotation_message` - The last execution status message. 
	* `last_rotation_status` - The status of last execution of auto key rotation.
	* `rotation_interval_in_days` - The interval of auto key rotation. For auto key rotation the interval should between 30 day and 365 days (1 year)
	* `time_of_last_rotation` - A  property indicating Last rotation Date Example: `2023-04-04T00:00:00Z`.
	* `time_of_next_rotation` - A property indicating Next estimated scheduled Time, as per the interval, expressed as date YYYY-MM-DD String. Example: `2023-04-04T00:00:00Z` .
	* `time_of_schedule_start` - A property indicating  scheduled start date expressed as date YYYY-MM-DD String. Example: `2023-04-04T00:00:00Z` .
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment that contains this master encryption key.
* `current_key_version` - The OCID of the key version used in cryptographic operations. During key rotation, the service might be in a transitional state where this or a newer key version are used intermittently. The `currentKeyVersion` property is updated when the service is guaranteed to use the new key version for all subsequent encryption operations. 
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name for the key. It does not have to be unique, and it is changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `external_key_reference_details` - Key reference data to be returned to the customer as a response.
	* `external_key_id` - ExternalKeyId refers to the globally unique key Id associated with the key created in external vault in CTM.
	* `external_key_version_id` - Key version ID associated with the external key.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The OCID of the key.
* `is_auto_rotation_enabled` - A parameter specifying whether the auto key rotation is enabled or not.
* `is_primary` - A Boolean value that indicates whether the Key belongs to primary Vault or replica vault.
* `key_shape` - The cryptographic properties of a key.
	* `algorithm` - The algorithm used by a key's key versions to encrypt or decrypt. Only AES algorithm is supported for `External` keys.
	* `curve_id` - Supported curve IDs for ECDSA keys.
	* `length` - The length of the key in bytes, expressed as an integer. Supported values include the following:
		* AES: 16, 24, or 32
		* RSA: 256, 384, or 512
		* ECDSA: 32, 48, or 66 
* `protection_mode` - The key's protection mode indicates how the key persists and where cryptographic operations that use the key are performed. A protection mode of `HSM` means that the key persists on a hardware security module (HSM) and all cryptographic operations are performed inside the HSM. A protection mode of `SOFTWARE` means that the key persists on the server, protected by the vault's RSA wrapping key which persists on the HSM. All cryptographic operations that use a key with a protection mode of `SOFTWARE` are performed on the server. By default, a key's protection mode is set to `HSM`. You can't change a key's protection mode after the key is created or imported. A protection mode of `EXTERNAL` mean that the key persists on the customer's external key manager which is hosted externally outside of oracle. Oracle only hold a reference to that key. All cryptographic operations that use a key with a protection mode of `EXTERNAL` are performed by external key manager. 
* `replica_details` - Key replica details 
	* `replication_id` - ReplicationId associated with a key operation 
* `restored_from_key_id` - The OCID of the key from which this key was restored.
* `restore_from_file` - Details where key was backed up.
    * `content_length` - content length of key's backup binary file
    * `content_md5` - content md5 hashed value of key's backup file
    * `restore_key_from_file_details` - Key backup file content
* `restore_from_object_store` - Details where key was backed up
    * `bucket` - Name of the bucket where key was backed up
    * `destination` - Type of backup to restore from. Values of "BUCKET", "PRE_AUTHENTICATED_REQUEST_URI" are supported
    * `namespace` - Namespace of the bucket where key was backed up
    * `object` - Object containing the backup
    * `uri` - Pre-authenticated-request-uri of the backup
* `restore_trigger` - When flipped, triggers restore if restore options are provided. Values of 0 or 1 are supported. 
* `state` - The key's current lifecycle state.  Example: `ENABLED` 
* `time_created` - The date and time the key was created, expressed in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) timestamp format.  Example: `2018-04-03T21:10:29.600Z` 
* `time_of_deletion` - An optional property indicating when to delete the key, expressed in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) timestamp format. Example: `2019-04-03T21:10:29.600Z` 
* `vault_id` - The OCID of the vault that contains this key.
