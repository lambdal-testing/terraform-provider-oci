# Data Source: oci_bastion_bastions
This data source provides the list of Bastions in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Bastion service.

Retrieves a list of BastionSummary objects in a compartment. Bastions provide secured, public access to target resources in the cloud that you cannot otherwise reach from the internet.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_bastion_bastions" "test_bastions" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	bastion_id = oci_bastion_bastion.test_bastion.id
	bastion_lifecycle_state = var.bastion_bastion_lifecycle_state
	name = var.bastion_name
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `bastion_id` - (Optional) The unique identifier (OCID) of the bastion in which to list resources.
* `bastion_lifecycle_state` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources their lifecycleState matches the given lifecycleState.
* `compartment_id` - (Required) The unique identifier (OCID) of the compartment in which to list resources.
* `name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire name given.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `bastions` - The list of bastions.
