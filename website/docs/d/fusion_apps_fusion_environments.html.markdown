	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	display_name = var.fusion_environment_display_name
	fusion_environment_family_id = oci_fusion_apps_fusion_environment_family.test_fusion_environment_family.id
	state = var.fusion_environment_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

		* `begin_times_value` - The frequency and month when maintenance occurs for the Fusion environment.
		* `override_type` - Determines if the maintenance schedule of the Fusion environment is inherited from the Fusion environment family.
