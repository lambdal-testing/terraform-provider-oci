# oci_recovery_protection_policy
This resource provides the Protection Policy resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Recovery service.

Creates a new Protection Policy.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_recovery_protection_policy" "test_protection_policy" {
	#Required
	backup_retention_period_in_days = var.protection_policy_backup_retention_period_in_days
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	display_name = var.protection_policy_display_name

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"foo-namespace.bar-key"= "value"}
	freeform_tags = {"bar-key"= "value"}
	policy_locked_date_time = var.protection_policy_policy_locked_date_time
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `backup_retention_period_in_days` - (Required) (Updatable) The maximum number of days to retain backups for a protected database.
* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) Compartment Identifier
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}`. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm) 
* `display_name` - (Required) (Updatable) A user provided name for the protection policy. The 'displayName' does not have to be unique, and it can be modified. Avoid entering confidential information.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `policy_locked_date_time` - (Optional) (Updatable) An RFC3339 formatted datetime string that specifies the exact date and time for the retention lock to take effect and permanently lock the retention period defined in the policy.
	* The retention lock feature controls whether Recovery Service strictly preserves backups for the duration defined in a policy. Retention lock is useful to enforce recovery window compliance and to prevent unintentional modifications to protected database backups.
	* Recovery Service enforces a 14-day delay before the retention lock set for a policy can take effect. Therefore, you must set policyLockedDateTime  to a date that occurs 14 days after the current date.
	* For example, assuming that the current date is Aug 1, 2023 9 pm, you can set policyLockedDateTime  to '2023-08-15T21:00:00.600Z' (Aug 15, 2023, 9:00 pm), or greater.
	* During the 14-day delay period, you can either increase or decrease the retention period in the policy.
	* However, you are only allowed to increase the retention period on or after the retention lock date.
	* You cannot change the value of policyLockedDateTime if the retention lock is already in effect. 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `backup_retention_period_in_days` - The maximum number of days to retain backups for a protected database. Specify a period ranging from a minimum 14 days to a maximum 95 days. For example, specify the value 55 if you want to retain backups for 55 days.
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment that contains the protection policy.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}`. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm) 
* `display_name` - A user provided name for the protection policy.
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `id` - The protection policy OCID.
* `is_predefined_policy` - Set to TRUE if the policy is Oracle-defined, and FALSE for a user-defined custom policy. You can modify only the custom policies.
* `lifecycle_details` - Detailed description about the current lifecycle state of the protection policy. For example, it can be used to provide actionable information for a resource in a Failed state.
* `policy_locked_date_time` - An RFC3339 formatted datetime string that specifies the exact date and time for the retention lock to take effect and permanently lock the retention period defined in the policy. 
* `state` - The current state of the protection policy. 
* `system_tags` - Usage of system tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}`. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm) 
* `time_created` - An RFC3339 formatted datetime string that indicates the created time for the protection policy. For example: '2020-05-22T21:10:29.600Z'. 
* `time_updated` - An RFC3339 formatted datetime string that indicates the updated time for the protection policy. For example: '2020-05-22T21:10:29.600Z'. 

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:
	* `create` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when creating the Protection Policy
	* `update` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when updating the Protection Policy
	* `delete` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when destroying the Protection Policy


## Import

ProtectionPolicies can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_recovery_protection_policy.test_protection_policy "id"
```
