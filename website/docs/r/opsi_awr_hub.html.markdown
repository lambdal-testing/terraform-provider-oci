	display_name = var.awr_hub_display_name
	operations_insights_warehouse_id = oci_opsi_operations_insights_warehouse.test_operations_insights_warehouse.id

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"foo-namespace.bar-key"= "value"}
	freeform_tags = {"bar-key"= "value"}
	object_storage_bucket_name = oci_objectstorage_bucket.test_bucket.name
}
```
