# oci_announcements_service_announcement_subscription
This resource provides the Announcement Subscription resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Announcements Service service.

Creates a new announcement subscription.

This call is subject to an Announcements limit that applies to the total number of requests across all read or write operations. Announcements might throttle this call to reject an otherwise valid request when the total rate of operations exceeds 20 requests per second for a given user. The service might also throttle this call to reject an otherwise valid request when the total rate of operations exceeds 100 requests per second for a given tenancy.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_announcements_service_announcement_subscription" "test_announcement_subscription" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	display_name = var.announcement_subscription_display_name
	ons_topic_id = oci_ons_notification_topic.test_notification_topic.id

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"foo-namespace.bar-key"= "value"}
	description = var.announcement_subscription_description
	filter_groups {
		#Required
		filters {
			#Required
			type = var.announcement_subscription_filter_groups_filters_type
			value = var.announcement_subscription_filter_groups_filters_value
		}
	}
	freeform_tags = {"bar-key"= "value"}
	preferred_language = var.announcement_subscription_preferred_language
	preferred_time_zone = var.announcement_subscription_preferred_time_zone
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment where you want to create the announcement subscription. 
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) A description of the announcement subscription. Avoid entering confidential information.
* `display_name` - (Required) (Updatable) A user-friendly name for the announcement subscription. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.
* `filter_groups` - (Optional) A list of filter groups for the announcement subscription. A filter group combines one or more filters that the Announcements service applies to announcements for matching purposes. 
	* `filters` - (Required) A list of filters against which the Announcements service matches announcements. You cannot have more than one of any given filter type within a filter group.
		* `type` - (Required) The type of filter.
		* `value` - (Required) The value of the filter.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `ons_topic_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The OCID of the Notifications service topic that is the target for publishing announcements that match the configured announcement subscription. The caller of the operation needs the ONS_TOPIC_PUBLISH permission for the targeted Notifications service topic. For more information about Notifications permissions, see [Details for Notifications](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/policyreference/notificationpolicyreference.htm). 
* `preferred_language` - (Optional) (Updatable) (For announcement subscriptions with Oracle Fusion Applications configured as the service only) The language in which the user prefers to receive emailed announcements. Specify the preference with a value that uses the language tag format (x-obmcs-human-language). For example fr-FR.
* `preferred_time_zone` - (Optional) (Updatable) The time zone that the user prefers for announcement time stamps. Specify the preference with a value that uses the IANA Time Zone Database format (x-obmcs-time-zone). For example America/Los_Angeles.
