# oci_identity_domains_security_question_setting
This resource provides the Security Question Setting resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity Domains service.

Replace a security question setting.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_identity_domains_security_question_setting" "test_security_question_setting" {
	#Required
	idcs_endpoint = data.oci_identity_domain.test_domain.url
	max_field_length = var.security_question_setting_max_field_length
	min_answer_length = var.security_question_setting_min_answer_length
	num_questions_to_ans = var.security_question_setting_num_questions_to_ans
	num_questions_to_setup = var.security_question_setting_num_questions_to_setup
	schemas = ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:oracle:idcs:SecurityQuestionSettings"]
	security_question_setting_id = oci_identity_domains_security_question_setting.test_security_question_setting.id

	#Optional
	attribute_sets = ["all"]
	attributes = ""
	authorization = var.security_question_setting_authorization
	external_id = "externalId"
	id = var.security_question_setting_id
	ocid = var.security_question_setting_ocid
	resource_type_schema_version = var.security_question_setting_resource_type_schema_version
	tags {
		#Required
		key = var.security_question_setting_tags_key
		value = var.security_question_setting_tags_value
	}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `attribute_sets` - (Optional) (Updatable) A multi-valued list of strings indicating the return type of attribute definition. The specified set of attributes can be fetched by the return type of the attribute. One or more values can be given together to fetch more than one group of attributes. If 'attributes' query parameter is also available, union of the two is fetched. Valid values - all, always, never, request, default. Values are case-insensitive.
* `attributes` - (Optional) (Updatable) A comma-delimited string that specifies the names of resource attributes that should be returned in the response. By default, a response that contains resource attributes contains only attributes that are defined in the schema for that resource type as returned=always or returned=default. An attribute that is defined as returned=request is returned in a response only if the request specifies its name in the value of this query parameter. If a request specifies this query parameter, the response contains the attributes that this query parameter specifies, as well as any attribute that is defined as returned=always.
* `authorization` - (Optional) (Updatable) The Authorization field value consists of credentials containing the authentication information of the user agent for the realm of the resource being requested.
* `compartment_ocid` - (Optional) (Updatable) Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compartment Id (ocid) in which the resource lives.

* `external_id` - (Optional) (Updatable) An identifier for the Resource as defined by the Service Consumer. The externalId may simplify identification of the Resource between Service Consumer and Service Provider by allowing the Consumer to refer to the Resource with its own identifier, obviating the need to store a local mapping between the local identifier of the Resource and the identifier used by the Service Provider. Each Resource MAY include a non-empty externalId value. The value of the externalId attribute is always issued by the Service Consumer and can never be specified by the Service Provider. The Service Provider MUST always interpret the externalId as scoped to the Service Consumer's tenant.

This identifier MUST be unique across the Service Provider's entire set of Resources. It MUST be a stable, non-reassignable identifier that does not change when the same Resource is returned in subsequent requests. The value of the id attribute is always issued by the Service Provider and MUST never be specified by the Service Consumer. bulkId: is a reserved keyword and MUST NOT be used in the unique identifier.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:
	* `create` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when creating the Security Question Setting
	* `update` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when updating the Security Question Setting
	* `delete` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when destroying the Security Question Setting


## Import

SecurityQuestionSettings can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_identity_domains_security_question_setting.test_security_question_setting "idcsEndpoint/{idcsEndpoint}/securityQuestionSettings/{securityQuestionSettingId}" 
```
