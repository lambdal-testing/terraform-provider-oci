# oci_core_drg_attachment_management
This resource provides the Drg Attachment Management resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

This can be used to update the Drg Attachments of the following types - 
"IPSEC_TUNNEL",
"REMOTE_PEERING_CONNECTION",
"VIRTUAL_CIRCUIT",

DRG Attachments for virtual circuits, IPSec tunnels, and remote peering connections are created (and deleted) automatically on your behalf when you create (or delete) the network object. Hence, this management resource is used to update these types of autogenerated DRG Attachments.
The user cannot create DRG attachments of these types as needed.

For the purposes of access control, the DRG attachment is automatically placed into the currently selected compartment.
For more information about compartments and access control, see
[Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm).


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_core_drg_attachment_management" "test_drg_rpc_attachment" {
  #Required
  attachment_type = "REMOTE_PEERING_CONNECTION"
  compartment_id = var.compartment_ocid
  network_id = oci_core_remote_peering_connection.test_rpc.id
  drg_id = oci_core_drg.test_drg.id

  #Optional
  display_name = "MyTestDrgAttachmentForRpc"
  drg_route_table_id = oci_core_drg_route_table.test_drg_route_table.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `attachment_type` - (Required) The type for the network resource attached to the DRG.
* `compartment_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
* `network_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the resource (virtual circuit, VCN, IPSec tunnel, or remote peering connection) attached to the DRG.

* `drg_route_table_id` - (Optional)(Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the DRG route table assigned to the DRG attachment.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional)(Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}`
* `network_details` - (Optional)(Updatable)
    * `id` -(Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the network attached to the DRG.
    * `ipsec_connection_id` - The IPSec connection that contains the attached IPSec tunnel.
    * `route_table_id` (Optional)(Updatable)- The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the route table the DRG attachment is using.

      For information about why you would associate a route table with a DRG attachment, see:
        * [Transit Routing: Access to Multiple VCNs in Same Region](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/transitrouting.htm)
        * [Transit Routing: Private Access to Oracle Services](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/transitroutingoracleservices.htm)
    * `type` (Required)- The type can be one of these values: `IPSEC_TUNNEL`, `REMOTE_PEERING_CONNECTION`, `VCN`,`VIRTUAL_CIRCUIT`
* `route_table_id`(Optional)(Updatable) - The OCID of the route table the DRG attachment is using.

  For information about why you would associate a route table with a DRG attachment, see:
    * [Transit Routing: Access to Multiple VCNs in Same Region](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/transitrouting.htm)
    * [Transit Routing: Private Access to Oracle Services](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/transitroutingoracleservices.htm) This field is deprecated. Instead, use the `networkDetails` field to view the [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the attached resource.
* `vcn_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the VCN.
* `export_drg_route_distribution_id` (Optional) (Updatable) - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the export route distribution used to specify how routes in the assigned DRG route table are advertised to the attachment. If this value is null, no routes are advertised through this attachment.
* `remove_export_drg_route_distribution_trigger` - (Optional) (Updatable) An optional property when set to true during update disables the export of route Distribution by setting export_drg_route_distribution_id to null.
