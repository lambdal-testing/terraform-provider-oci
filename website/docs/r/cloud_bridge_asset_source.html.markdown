# oci_cloud_bridge_asset_source
This resource provides the Asset Source resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Cloud Bridge service.

Creates an asset source.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_cloud_bridge_asset_source" "test_asset_source" {
	#Required
	assets_compartment_id = oci_identity_compartment.test_compartment.id
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	discovery_credentials {
		#Required
		secret_id = oci_vault_secret.test_secret.id
		type = var.asset_source_discovery_credentials_type
	}
	environment_id = oci_cloud_bridge_environment.test_environment.id
	inventory_id = oci_cloud_bridge_inventory.test_inventory.id
	type = var.asset_source_type
	vcenter_endpoint = var.asset_source_vcenter_endpoint

	#Optional
	are_historical_metrics_collected = var.asset_source_are_historical_metrics_collected
	are_realtime_metrics_collected = var.asset_source_are_realtime_metrics_collected
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	discovery_schedule_id = oci_cloud_bridge_discovery_schedule.test_discovery_schedule.id
	display_name = var.asset_source_display_name

	replication_credentials {
		#Required
		secret_id = oci_vault_secret.test_secret.id
		type = var.asset_source_replication_credentials_type
	}
	system_tags = var.asset_source_system_tags
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `are_historical_metrics_collected` - (Optional) (Updatable) Flag indicating whether historical metrics are collected for assets, originating from this asset source.
