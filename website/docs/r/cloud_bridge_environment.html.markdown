## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_cloud_bridge_environment" "test_environment" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	display_name = var.environment_display_name
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) Compartment identifier.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) The defined tags associated with this resource, if any. Each key is predefined and scoped to namespaces. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) Environment identifier.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) The freeform tags associated with this resource, if any. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace/scope. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}`
