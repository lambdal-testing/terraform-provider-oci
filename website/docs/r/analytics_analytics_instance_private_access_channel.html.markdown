# oci_analytics_analytics_instance_private_access_channel
This resource provides the Analytics Instance Private Access Channel resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Analytics service.

Create a Private access Channel for the Analytics instance. The operation is long-running
and creates a new WorkRequest.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_analytics_analytics_instance_private_access_channel" "test_analytics_instance_private_access_channel" {
	#Required
	analytics_instance_id = oci_analytics_analytics_instance.test_analytics_instance.id
	display_name = var.analytics_instance_private_access_channel_display_name
	private_source_dns_zones {
		#Required
		dns_zone = var.analytics_instance_private_access_channel_private_source_dns_zones_dns_zone

		#Optional
		description = var.analytics_instance_private_access_channel_private_source_dns_zones_description
	}
	subnet_id = oci_core_subnet.test_subnet.id
	vcn_id = oci_core_vcn.test_vcn.id

	#Optional
	network_security_group_ids = var.analytics_instance_private_access_channel_network_security_group_ids
	private_source_scan_hosts {
		#Required
		scan_hostname = var.analytics_instance_private_access_channel_private_source_scan_hosts_scan_hostname
		scan_port = var.analytics_instance_private_access_channel_private_source_scan_hosts_scan_port

		#Optional
		description = var.analytics_instance_private_access_channel_private_source_scan_hosts_description
	}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `analytics_instance_id` - (Required) The OCID of the AnalyticsInstance. 
* `display_name` - (Required) (Updatable) Display Name of the Private Access Channel. 
* `network_security_group_ids` - (Optional) (Updatable) Network Security Group OCIDs for an Analytics instance. 
* `private_source_dns_zones` - (Required) (Updatable) List of Private Source DNS zones registered with Private Access Channel, where datasource hostnames from these dns zones / domains will be resolved in the peered VCN for access from Analytics Instance. Min of 1 is required and Max of 30 Private Source DNS zones can be registered. 
	* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) Description of private source dns zone. 
	* `dns_zone` - (Required) (Updatable) Private Source DNS Zone. Ex: example-vcn.oraclevcn.com, corp.example.com. 
* `private_source_scan_hosts` - (Optional) (Updatable) List of Private Source DB SCAN hosts registered with Private Access Channel for access from Analytics Instance. 
	* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) Description of private source scan host zone. 
	* `scan_hostname` - (Required) (Updatable) Private Source Scan hostname. Ex: db01-scan.corp.example.com, prd-db01-scan.mycompany.com. 
	* `scan_port` - (Required) (Updatable) Private Source Scan host port. This is the source port where SCAN protocol will get connected (e.g. 1521). 
* `subnet_id` - (Required) (Updatable) OCID of the customer subnet connected to private access channel. 
* `vcn_id` - (Required) (Updatable) OCID of the customer VCN peered with private access channel. 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
