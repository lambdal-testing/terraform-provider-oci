# oci_stack_monitoring_monitored_resource
This resource provides the Monitored Resource resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Stack Monitoring service.

Creates a new monitored resource for the given resource type with the details and submits 
a work request for promoting the resource to agent. Once the resource is successfully 
added to agent, resource state will be marked active.
