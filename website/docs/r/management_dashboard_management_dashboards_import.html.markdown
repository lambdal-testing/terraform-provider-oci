# oci_management_dashboard_management_dashboards_import
This resource provides the Management Dashboards Import resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Management Dashboard service.

Imports an array of dashboards and their saved searches. 
Here's an example of how you can use CLI to import a dashboard. For information on the details that must be passed to IMPORT, you can use the EXPORT API to obtain the Import.json file: 
`oci management-dashboard dashboard export --query data --export-dashboard-id "{\"dashboardIds\":[\"ocid1.managementdashboard.oc1..dashboardId1\"]}"  > Import.json`. 
Note that import API updates the resource if it already exists, and creates a new resource if it does not exist. To import to a different compartment, edit and change the compartmentId to the desired compartment OCID. 
Here's an example of how you can use CLI to import:
`oci management-dashboard dashboard import --from-json file://Import.json`
