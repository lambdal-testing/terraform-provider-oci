# oci_kms_sign
This resource provides the Sign resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Kms service.

Creates a digital signature for a message or message digest by using the private key of a public-private key pair,
also known as an asymmetric key. To verify the generated signature, you can use the [Verify](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/key/latest/VerifiedData/Verify)
operation. Or, if you want to validate the signature outside of the service, you can do so by using the public key of the same asymmetric key.
This operation is not supported for keys having protection mode `EXTERNAL`.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_kms_sign" "test_sign" {
	#Required
	crypto_endpoint = var.sign_message_crypto_endpoint
	key_id = oci_kms_key.test_key.id
	message = var.sign_message
	signing_algorithm = var.sign_signing_algorithm

	#Optional
	key_version_id = oci_kms_key_version.test_key_version.id
	logging_context = var.sign_logging_context
	message_type = var.sign_message_type
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `crypto_endpoint` - (Required) The service endpoint to perform cryptographic operations against. Cryptographic operations include 'Encrypt,' 'Decrypt,', 'GenerateDataEncryptionKey', 'Sign' and 'Verify' operations. see Vault Crypto endpoint.
* `key_id` - (Required) The OCID of the key used to sign the message.
* `key_version_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the key version used to sign the message.
* `logging_context` - (Optional) Information that can be used to provide context for audit logging. It is a map that contains any additional data that you provide to include with audit logs, if audit logging is enabled. 
* `message` - (Required) The base64-encoded binary data object denoting the message or message digest to sign. You can have a message up to 4096 bytes in size. To sign a larger message, provide the message digest.
* `message_type` - (Optional) Denotes whether the value of the message parameter is a raw message or a message digest. The default value, `RAW`, indicates a message. To indicate a message digest, use `DIGEST`. 
* `signing_algorithm` - (Required) The algorithm to use to sign the message or message digest. For RSA keys, supported signature schemes include PKCS #1 and RSASSA-PSS, along with different hashing algorithms. For ECDSA keys, ECDSA is the supported signature scheme with different hashing algorithms. When you pass a message digest for signing, ensure that you specify the same hashing algorithm as used when creating the message digest. 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `key_id` - The OCID of the key used to sign the message.
* `key_version_id` - The OCID of the key version used to sign the message.
* `signature` - The base64-encoded binary data object denoting the cryptographic signature generated for the message or message digest. 
* `signing_algorithm` - The algorithm to use to sign the message or message digest. For RSA keys, supported signature schemes include PKCS #1 and RSASSA-PSS, along with different hashing algorithms. For ECDSA keys, ECDSA is the supported signature scheme with different hashing algorithms. When you pass a message digest for signing, ensure that you specify the same hashing algorithm as used when creating the message digest. 

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:
	* `create` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when creating the Sign
	* `update` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when updating the Sign
	* `delete` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when destroying the Sign


## Import

Sign can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_kms_sign.test_sign "id"
```
