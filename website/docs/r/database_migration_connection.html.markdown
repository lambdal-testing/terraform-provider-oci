# oci_database_migration_connection
This resource provides the Connection resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database Migration service.

Create a Database Connection resource that contains the details to connect to either a Source or Target Database
in the migration.

		#Required
		password = var.connection_admin_credentials_password
		username = var.connection_admin_credentials_username
	}
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	database_type = var.connection_database_type
	vault_details {
		#Required
		compartment_id = var.compartment_id
