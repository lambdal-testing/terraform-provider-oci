# oci_vulnerability_scanning_host_scan_target
This resource provides the Host Scan Target resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vulnerability Scanning service.

Creates a new HostScanTarget. A host scan target is a collection of compute instances that you want routinely scanned for security vulnerabilities.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_vulnerability_scanning_host_scan_target" "test_host_scan_target" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	host_scan_recipe_id = oci_vulnerability_scanning_host_scan_recipe.test_host_scan_recipe.id
	target_compartment_id = oci_identity_compartment.test_compartment.id

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"foo-namespace.bar-key"= "value"}
	description = var.host_scan_target_description
	display_name = var.host_scan_target_display_name
	freeform_tags = {"bar-key"= "value"}
	instance_ids = var.host_scan_target_instance_ids
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) Compartment ID of the object (this).
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) Target description.
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) Target identifier, which can be renamed. If not present, it will be auto-generated. Avoid entering confidential information.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `host_scan_recipe_id` - (Required) (Updatable) ID of the host scan recipe this target applies.
* `instance_ids` - (Optional) (Updatable) List of compute instance IDs to target (optional). If empty, targets the entire targetCompartmentId.
* `target_compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) Compartment ID to target. If a list of hosts is provided, all hosts must be in this compartment.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - Compartment ID of the object (this).
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `description` - Target description.
* `display_name` - Target identifier, which can be renamed.
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `host_scan_recipe_id` - ID of the host scan recipe this target applies.
* `id` - Unique identifier of the config that is immutable on creation
* `instance_ids` - List of compute instance IDs to target (optional). If empty, targets the entire targetCompartmentId.
* `state` - The current state of the config.
* `system_tags` - Usage of system tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}` 
* `target_compartment_id` - Compartment ID to target. If a list of hosts is provided, all hosts must be in this compartment.
* `time_created` - Date and time the target was created, format as described in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339)
* `time_updated` - Date and time the target was last updated, format as described in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339)

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:
	* `create` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when creating the Host Scan Target
	* `update` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when updating the Host Scan Target
	* `delete` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when destroying the Host Scan Target


## Import

HostScanTargets can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_vulnerability_scanning_host_scan_target.test_host_scan_target "id"
```
