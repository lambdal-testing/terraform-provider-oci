	#Required
	recommendation_id = oci_optimizer_recommendation.test_recommendation.id
	status = var.recommendation_status

	#Optional
	time_status_end = var.recommendation_time_status_end
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `recommendation_id` - (Required) The unique OCID associated with the recommendation.
* `status` - (Required) (Updatable) The status of the recommendation.
* `time_status_end` - (Optional) (Updatable) The date and time the current status will change. The format is defined by RFC3339.
