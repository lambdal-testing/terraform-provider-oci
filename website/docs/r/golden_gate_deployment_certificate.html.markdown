# oci_golden_gate_deployment_certificate
This resource provides the Deployment Certificate resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Golden Gate service.

Creates a new certificate to truststore.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_golden_gate_deployment_certificate" "test_deployment_certificate" {
	#Required
	certificate_content = var.deployment_certificate_certificate_content
	deployment_id = oci_golden_gate_deployment.test_deployment.id
	key = var.deployment_certificate_key

	#Optional
	is_lock_override = var.deployment_certificate_is_lock_override
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `certificate_content` - (Required) The base64 encoded content of the PEM file containing the SSL certificate. 
* `deployment_id` - (Required) A unique Deployment identifier. 
* `is_lock_override` - (Optional) Whether to override locks (if any exist).
* `key` - (Required) The identifier key (unique name in the scope of the deployment) of the certificate being referenced.  It must be 1 to 32 characters long, must contain only alphanumeric characters and must start with a letter.
