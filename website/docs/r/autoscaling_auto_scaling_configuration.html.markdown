## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `auto_scaling_resources` - (Required) A resource that is managed by an autoscaling configuration. The only supported type is `instancePool`.

	Each instance pool can have one autoscaling configuration. 
	* `id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the resource that is managed by the autoscaling configuration. 
	* `type` - (Required) The type of resource.
* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment containing the autoscaling configuration. 
* `cool_down_in_seconds` - (Optional) (Updatable) For threshold-based autoscaling policies, this value is the minimum period of time to wait between scaling actions. The cooldown period gives the system time to stabilize before rescaling. The minimum value is 300 seconds, which is also the default. The cooldown period starts when the instance pool reaches the running state.

	For schedule-based autoscaling policies, this value is not used. 
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `is_enabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Whether the autoscaling configuration is enabled.
* `policies` - (Required) Autoscaling policy definitions for the autoscaling configuration. An autoscaling policy defines the criteria that trigger autoscaling actions and the actions to take. 
	* `capacity` - (Optional) The capacity requirements of the autoscaling policy.
		* `initial` - (Optional) For a threshold-based autoscaling policy, this value is the initial number of instances to launch in the instance pool immediately after autoscaling is enabled. After autoscaling retrieves performance metrics, the number of instances is automatically adjusted from this initial number to a number that is based on the limits that you set.

			For a schedule-based autoscaling policy, this value is the target pool size to scale to when executing the schedule that's defined in the autoscaling policy. 
		* `max` - (Optional) For a threshold-based autoscaling policy, this value is the maximum number of instances the instance pool is allowed to increase to (scale out).

			For a schedule-based autoscaling policy, this value is not used. 
		* `min` - (Optional) For a threshold-based autoscaling policy, this value is the minimum number of instances the instance pool is allowed to decrease to (scale in).

			For a schedule-based autoscaling policy, this value is not used. 
	* `display_name` - (Optional) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
	* `execution_schedule` - (Required when policy_type=scheduled) An execution schedule for an autoscaling policy. 
		* `expression` - (Required) A cron expression that represents the time at which to execute the autoscaling policy.

			Cron expressions have this format: `<second> <minute> <hour> <day of month> <month> <day of week> <year>`

			You can use special characters that are supported with the Quartz cron implementation.

			You must specify `0` as the value for seconds.

			Example: `0 15 10 ? * *` 
		* `timezone` - (Required) The time zone for the execution schedule.
		* `type` - (Required) The type of execution schedule.
	* `is_enabled` - (Optional) Whether the autoscaling policy is enabled.
	* `policy_type` - (Required) The type of autoscaling policy.
	* `resource_action` - (Applicable when policy_type=scheduled) An action that can be executed against a resource.
		* `action` - (Required) 
		* `action_type` - (Required) The type of resource action.
	* `rules` - (Required when policy_type=threshold) 
		* `action` - (Required when policy_type=threshold) The action to take when autoscaling is triggered. 
			* `type` - (Required when policy_type=threshold) The type of action to take.
			* `value` - (Required when policy_type=threshold) To scale out (increase the number of instances), provide a positive value. To scale in (decrease the number of instances), provide a negative value. 
		* `display_name` - (Required when policy_type=threshold) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique. Avoid entering confidential information. This value is not changeable through Terraform. 
		* `metric` - (Required when policy_type=threshold) Metric and threshold details for triggering an autoscaling action. 
			* `metric_type` - (Required when policy_type=threshold) 
			* `threshold` - (Required when policy_type=threshold) 
				* `operator` - (Required when policy_type=threshold) The comparison operator to use. Options are greater than (`GT`), greater than or equal to (`GTE`), less than (`LT`), and less than or equal to (`LTE`). 
				* `value` - (Required when policy_type=threshold) 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
